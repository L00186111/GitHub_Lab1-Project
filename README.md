# GitHub_Lab1-Project
## Description
Software development is an expanding fast-paced career path in high tech world. A system is a range of development versions that hold a wide variety of stable software for a fast-growing software development of any business. A software should be able to adapt to the ever-changing business requirement as quickly as possible
So, the following report intends to report the introduction of Git & GitHub approach on version control to the cloud world transition activity. By using pull request (prs), branching, fork, kanban boards, etc. we will discuss methods and processes to make our cloud team and individual work more adoptable towards cloud nature.

An open-source version control management system such as Git is an example of a powerful tool that helps developers manage and track code over time. By keeping a complete history of all changes, Git allows developers to collaborate on projects and experiment with different ideas and roll back, if needed. It is also distributed (to make it reliable and allow for offline flexible settings), which means that each developer has a full local copy of the project history.GitHub, in contrast, is a hosted service for Git repositories that comes with more features like collaboration tools, issue tracking and project management. GitHub: An interface serving to share and incorporate code changes, review contributions, and manage workflows.it allows many developers to work together. It also enables collaborative changes to a repository via pull requests, allowing for proposed changes to be reviewed and discussed before being merged into the primary project. GitHub is not just a code hosting site it integrates with CI/CD, documentation, etc. for org development and open-source development.

## Method
### We have several major processes and approaches for git:

*	Change Tracking: History of changes to the code. All modifications are documented.
*	Repo: A repository is where the project, and every single change you have ever made to that project, is stored.
*	Staging Area: A place to prepare code changes and determine whether it is ready to be committed to the repository.
*	Commit: This command creates a snapshot of the current state of the code and saves it to the local repository along with a message describing the change.
*	Branching: Allows development in different lines, separating work on features or fixes.
*	Merging: This applies the changes from the various branches, which might involve mixing them into a single branch while resolving conflicts (e.g. when two separate changes modify the same line in the source code)
*	Pull — Merge updates from the remote to the local branch.
*	Push: This allows us to push commit changes from the local repo to remote repo and share updates from other developers on the same project.

### GitHub Processes and Methods (Background)
*	Remote Repo: A Git repo hosted in GitHub to work with other people.
*	Fork: Allows you to pull someone else's repository to create a snapshot for you to play with as needed to make your changes to the source without affecting the original.
*	Pull Request (PR): PR is used for proposing a changeset to a project to be merged where it can be discussed and seen before approved.
*	Code Review: Allows collaborators to comment and propose revisions to pull requests and keep quality.
*	Issues and Issue Tracking: A simple system for tracking bugs and features or to track any tasks associated with a project with assigned labels, milestones and assignees.
*	Collaborator access — a way for repo owners to control who can commit/review code
*	Actions and CI/CD: Automation tools to build, test and deploy code together, forming the development workflow.

## Results 
Appropriate use of Git and GitHub returns a few key outcomes for teams building software and open-source projects. Some of the key outcomes you can look forward to are as follows:
### Key Results of Using Git:
*	Seamless Merges: Teams working on different features or fixes using branches can then merge those changes with ease.
*	Easily Trackable History: Every change comes with a timestamp, the author, and description so there is a complete history of a project that can be verified and audited.
*	Quality and Stability of Code: Developers can experiment in different branches and switch back to stable versions whenever necessary, keeping the main codebase reliable.
*	Fewer Conflicts: Since Git offers isolated branches within the team, this translates to fewer conflicts and the merge tools help you to non-destructively resolve any when they occur.
*	Developers can create feature branches to experiment with new ideas, validate concepts, or refactor code, safe in the knowledge that the main code base will remain unaffected.
*	Shorter Development Cycles: Using Git, developers are enabling to work in parallel without waiting for others which speeds up the overall development process.

### Key Results of Using GitHub:

*	Smooth Code Reviewing and Quality Management: Pull requests make it easy to perform code reviews, discussions, and joint bug fixes that result in better code.
*	Improved Visibility of Projects: The issues and project boards give stakeholders a comprehensive view of project status, upcoming work, and who is contributing.
*	Proficient Problem and Task Tracking The issue and labelling system provided by GitHub sorts bugs, feature requests, and other tasks so teams can prioritize their work better.
*	Built-in CI/CD: GitHub Actions allows you to automate your CI/CD pipelines without worrying about orchestration. GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with worldclass CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub.
*	GitHub Wikis and README-files on GitHub help in maintaining project documentation in an organized way so that the information is updated and accessible to all the people looking for it.
*	Encouraging Community & Contributions: Forking, a star, and a forking promote open-source contributions that attract a variety of competitive thoughts and enhancements to projects.
*	Controlled and Managed Collaboration: The permissions and access rights enable teams to manage viewers and editors or even administrators of the project for secure contributions.
*	When you use both Git and GitHub together, you get an amazing collaborative environment where the software development process will be organized, replicable, and significantly faster.
