# GitHub_Lab1-Project
## Description
Software development is an expanding fast-paced career path in high tech world. A system is a range of development versions that hold a wide variety of stable software for a fast-growing software development of any business. A software should be able to adapt to the ever-changing business requirement as quickly as possible
So, the following report intends to report the introduction of Git & GitHub approach on version control to the cloud world transition activity. By using pull request (prs), branching, fork, kanban boards, etc. we will discuss methods and processes to make our cloud team and individual work more adoptable towards cloud nature.

An open-source version control management system such as Git is an example of a powerful tool that helps developers manage and track code over time. By keeping a complete history of all changes, Git allows developers to collaborate on projects and experiment with different ideas and roll back, if needed. It is also distributed (to make it reliable and allow for offline flexible settings), which means that each developer has a full local copy of the project history.
GitHub, in contrast, is a hosted service for Git repositories that comes with more features like collaboration tools, issue tracking and project management. GitHub: An interface serving to share and incorporate code changes, review contributions, and manage workflows. it allows many developers to work together. It also enables collaborative changes to a repository via pull requests, allowing for proposed changes to be reviewed and discussed before being merged into the primary project. GitHub is not just a code hosting site - it integrates with CI/CD, documentation, etc. for org development and open-source development.
